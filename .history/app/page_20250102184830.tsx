            Iâ€™m a web developer and designer with a versatile background
            spanning branding, UI/UX, and marketing. Currently, I lead creative
            and technical efforts as Web Developer & Designer at RevEng.ai,
            where I designed our brand identity, developed a sleek web app
            dashboard with React and Next.js, and crafted a cohesive user
            experience with Tailwind CSS. Previously, I was a Designer at
            Playground XYZ, where I established brand guidelines, rebuilt the
            company website in Webflow, and shaped the creative direction for
            core products. My career also includes time at Cyclr, building API
            connectors, and The Cheeky Panda, where I combined design and
            marketing expertise to drive product success on global Amazon
            marketplaces.
